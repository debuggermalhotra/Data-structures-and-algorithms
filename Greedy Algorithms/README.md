#Algorithms using Greedy technique.

#####A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage[1] with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.

###In general, greedy algorithms have five components:

<ol>
1.A candidate set, from which a solution is created
2.A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution
3.A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution
4.An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution, and
5.A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution
</ol>
